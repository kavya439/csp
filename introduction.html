<h1 style="font-size:25px;text-align:center">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height:30px;margin-bottom:50px;">   
     Diabetes and chronic diseases are significant health challenges facing people worldwide.
     They often share common risk factors and can have far-reaching implications for both individual health and societal well-being.
     Diabetes and chronic diseases are significant health challenges that often share common risk factors, such as lifestyle choices, genetics, age, and obesity.
     These conditions can have far-reaching implications for individuals and society, leading to disability, increased mortality, and economic burden.
     However, many chronic diseases can be prevented or managed through healthy lifestyle choices, early detection, and effective treatment, emphasizing the 
     importance of proactive healthcare measures.</p>
     <pre style="font-size:20px;text-align:justify;line-height:30px;margin-bottom:50px;">
        <b>Types of Diabetes:</b>

        <b>Type 1:</b> This type usually occurs in children and young adults. It's an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and 
         destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.   
        <b>Type 2:</b> This is the most common type, often diagnosed in adults. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't 
         produce enough insulin.
        <b>Gestational Diabetes:</b>This develops during pregnancy. It usually goes away after the baby is born but can increase the risk of 
         developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
        <b>Chronic Diseases:</b>A Global Health Challenge Chronic diseases are those that persist for a long time, often with no cure. They are a 
        significant global health issue, affecting millions of people worldwide.

        <b>Some common chronic diseases include:</b>  
        <b>Heart disease:</b>This includes conditions like coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke.   
        <b>Cancer:</b> A group of diseases characterized by abnormal cell growth and division.   
        <b>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):</b> A lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe.   
        <b>Diabetes:</b> Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't use insulin properly. 
        <b>Arthritis:</b> A group of conditions that cause joint inflammation and pain.
         
        <b>Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases:</b>
         Many factors can contribute to the development of chronic diseases, including:
        <b>Lifestyle:</b> Unhealthy habits like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption,poor diet, and lack of physical activity.   
        <b>Genetics:</b> Some people may have a genetic predisposition to certain chronic diseases.   
        <b>Age:</b> As people get older, their risk of developing chronic diseases increases.   
        <b>Environmental factors:</b> Exposure to certain pollutants or toxins can contribute to chronic illness.   

        <b> Prevention and Management:</b>
         While there may not be a cure for many chronic diseases, lifestyle modifications, medical treatments, and early detection can
         help prevent or manage them.
        <b> This includes:</b>
        <b> Healthy diet:</b> Consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.   
        <b> Regular physical activity:</b> Engaging in regular exercise can help control weight and improve overall health.   
        <b> Avoiding unhealthy habits:</b> Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, and managing stress.
        <b> Regular medical check-ups:</b> Early detection and treatment can help prevent complications.   
         By understanding the nature of diabetes and other chronic diseases, and taking proactive steps to prevent or manage them, individuals
         can improve their quality of life and reduce the burden of these conditions on healthcare systems.
